# DCA  

*Direct Clustering Algorithm in R*  

**Direct clustering algorithm (DCA)** is a methodology for identification of cellular manufacturing structure within an existing manufacturing shop. The DCA was introduced in 1982 by H.M. Chan and D.A. Milner [1] The algorithm restructures the existing machine / component (product) matrix of a shop by switching the rows and columns in such a way that a resulting matrix shows component families (groups) with corresponding machine groups. See Group technology. The algorithm is executable in manual way but was already suitable for computer use of the time. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_clustering_algorithm)  
  
This algorithm can be executed by the computer, using R
